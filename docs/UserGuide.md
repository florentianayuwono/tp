## 3. Introduction

SoConnect is a **2-in-1 desktop app for managing contacts and tasks**. It is originally built to help <a href="#nus">NUS</a> SoC students stay better connected to their school life, in terms of social connections and school tasks.

SoConnect leverages on the simplicity of Command Line Interface (<a href="#cli">CLI</a>) to optimize your productivity, while still maintaining user-friendliness through its Graphical User Interface (<a href="#gui">GUI</a>). If you can type fast, SoConnect can get your contact and task management work done faster than even the popular applications such as Microsoft People and To Do!

Let's look at the overview of our main features.

3. **Tag** specific people in your contact list.
4. **Search** efficiently, just like using Google.
5. What's more, we even let you **customise** how you want your contact list to be shown!

### 3.2. Todo Management

SoConnect helps you keep track of your <a href="#todo">todo</a> list, so that you can focus on finishing tasks quickly. You can:
1. Quickly **add, view, edit and delete** your todo.

</div>

### 5.2. Operating Systems

SoConnect currently can run smoothly on these operating systems:

1. Ubuntu
2. MacOS
3. Windows

You can download and use [`SoConnect.jar`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/releases) on any of the above operating systems. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Quickstart

Upon completing this section, you should be able to explore SoConnect on your own. We will start by explaining [different parts of the GUI](#61-layout), [key definitions](#62-key-definitions), [command format](#63-command-format), as well as [trying out simple commands](#64-how-to-use-the-cli).

### 6.1. Layout

### 6.2. Key Definitions

### 6.3. Command Format

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Tasks will be referred to as Todos

* `INDEX` is used in commands to refer to a specific contact or todo by their index number on the currently displayed contact list and todo list. The `INDEX` **must be a positive non-zero integer** 1, 2, 3, …​ <a id="command-format-index"></a>

### 6.4. How to Use the CLI

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Commands


### 7.1. General Commands

#### 7.1.1. Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

<br>

#### 7.1.2. Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<br>

#### 7.1.3. Saving the data

SoConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<br>

#### 7.1.4. Editing the data file

SoConnect contacts data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/soconnect.json`.<br>
SoConnect todos data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/todolist.json`.<br>
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing these data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SoConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

<br>

#### 7.1.5. Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

<br>

### 7.2. Contact Management Commands

#### 7.2.1. Adding a contact: `add`

Adds a contact to your SoConnect.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** The tag has to be created first before you can add it into a contact. 

Refer to [`Creating a Tag`](#creating-a-tag-tag-create) on how to create a tag.
</div>

* Duplicate name is not allowed. A name is considered duplicate if it has the exact same characters (case-sensitive) with an existing contact's name. For example, `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex yeoh` is considered different. This is to increase users' easiness in differentiating between contacts in the future. It is also to prevent users from creating new contacts when their actual intention is to edit a field from existing contacts.
* `NAME` currently only accepts alphanumeric values. This is to prevent users from supplying mistyped names into their contacts. However, numbers are still accepted to provide users a mean to differentiate between similar names and to account for special names that originally have numbers in it. 

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567`

<br>

#### 7.2.2. Editing a contact : `edit`

Edits an existing contact in your SoConnect.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values, provided that the input values do not violate constraints set by other features. For example, editing a name with input value that is considered duplicate in `add` feature is not allowed.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower`.

<br>

#### 7.2.3. Listing all contacts : `list`

Shows a list of all contacts in your SoConnect.

Format: `list`

<br>

#### 7.2.4. Searching for a contact: `search`

Search for contacts using partial information.

Format: `search [CONDITION] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…`

* `search t/TAG1 t/TAG2…` searches for contacts that contain all the given tags.
* `search and n/NAME p/PHONE…` searches for contacts that match all the given information.
* `search n/NAME p/PHONE…` and `search and n/NAME p/PHONE…` will return the same contacts that match all the given information.
* `search or t/TAG1 t/TAG2…` searches for contacts that contain any of the given tags.
* The search using `n/NAME` is case-insensitive. (e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`).
* Displays a list of relevant contacts related to the search query if no search result available. A contact is considered relevant if there are high matches of characters between the contact information and search keyword. For example, `David Li` and `Charlotte` are relevant to `search n/al` because these names contain characters `a` and `l` in it.

Example:
* `search t/family` returns all contacts tagged with family in the contact list.
* `search and a/NUS p/86178789` returns all contacts with that address and phone number.
* `search t/cs2103t t/tp` returns all contacts tagged with both cs2103t and tp.
* `search or t/friends t/family` returns all contacts tagged with either friends or family.
* `search n/Johm` is supposed to return an empty result since there is no contact named `Johm` in the list of contacts, but now it will return contacts with names similar to that. For example, `John`.

Autocompleting search: `search`

Displays a list of search queries based on the current search query with the last parameter completed. The completed parameter will depend on the contacts that match the current search query. User can choose one of the search queries and perform the searching without having to type the full parameter.

Format: Refer to the [`search`](#724-searching-for-a-contact-search) command format above.

* This feature is only available when search command is entered (i.e. the command entered matches the [`search`](#724-searching-for-a-contact-search) format stated above).
* Only the last parameter will be completed (e.g. `search and n/NAME p/PHONE`, only the last parameter `PHONE` will be completed).
* The list of search queries will include the current search query.
* No result will be displayed if there is no contact matches the current search query.
* No result will be displayed if the last parameter is empty.

Example:
* `search or n/John p/` displays nothing as the last parameter `PHONE` is empty.
* `search and n/John a/N`, displays a list of search queries containing `search and n/John a/N` and `search and n/John a/NUS` if SoConnect has contacts with name `John` and address `NUS`
* `search and n/John a/N` displays nothing if SoConnect does not have any contact with name `John` or has contact with name `John` but does not start with `N`.
* `search or n/John a/N` displays a list of search queries containing `search and n/John a/N`, `search and n/John a/NUS`, `search and n/John a/NYC` if SoConnect has contacts with address `NTU` and `NYC`, does not have to care about the name in the contact since it is `or` condition.
* `search or n/John a/N` displays nothing if SoConnect does not have contacts with address starts with `N`.

<br>

#### 7.2.5. Sorting contacts : `sort`

Sorts the list of contacts displayed by 1 or more parameter(s) chosen by you.

How *names (n/)*, *emails (e/)*, *addresses (a/ )* are sorted:
* In alphabetical order. (e.g. `Al` comes before `Alfred` which comes before `Brad`)
* Case insensitive. (e.g. `Al`, `al`, `AL`, and `aL` are identical when it comes to sorting)

How *phone numbers (p/)* are sorted: 
* In increasing numerical order. (e.g. `123` comes before `125` which comes before `1234`)

How *tags (t/TAG)* are sorted:
* Contacts with the *TAG* you specified will come before contacts without the *TAG*.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* When sorting by tags, unlike other parameters, you have to specify a value (an existing `TAG`) to sort by.
* For other parameters (i.e. `n/ e/ a/ p/`), values provided are ignored. (e.g. sorting by `n/Alfred` is a valid command, the list will be sorted by name and the given value `Alfred` is ignored)

</div>

Format: `sort [n/] [p/] [e/] [a/] [t/TAG]…​`
* To sort in reverse order from the orders given above, use these modified parameters: `[n/!] [p/!] [e/!] [a/!] [t/!TAG]`.
* To sort with multiple parameters, arrange the parameters in order of decreasing priority.
  * The list will be sorted by the first parameter.
  * If ties occur (e.g. both contacts have the exact same name), the second parameter will be used to sort the tied contacts.
  * If the tie still occurs, the third parameter will be used.
  * Repeat until the tie is resolved or there are no more parameters.

Example:
* `sort n/` sorts by names. (e.g. `David` appears before `Mike`)
* `sort t/!friend` sorts by the `friend` tag in reverse. (e.g. `Mike` appears before `David` who has the `friend` tag)
* `sort t/friend n/` sorts by the `friend` tag first, followed by names. (e.g. `David` and `Fred` who have the `friend` tag appear before `Mike`, `David` appears before `Fred`)

<br>

#### 7.2.6. Deleting a contact : `delete`

Deletes the specified contact from your SoConnect.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the contact at the specified `INDEX`.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd contact in your SoConnect.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st contact in the results of the `find` command.

<br>

#### 7.2.7. Clearing all contacts : `clear`

Clears all contacts from your SoConnect.

Format: `clear`

<br>

### 7.3. Todo Management Commands

A <a href="#todo">todo</a> is a task that needs completing. A todo consists of 
1. a description
2. a date for the deadline of the task
3. the priority of the task 
4. (optional) tags to help you categorise your todos

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Duplicate todos are not allowed (to help you avoid adding a todo that you forgot you already added). If you need to have todos with the same description, you are still able to do so, as long as the todos have different tags, dates, or priorities.
* Priority of a todo can strictly only be `low`, `medium`, or `high`. `Coming soon in v1.5`, we will add smarter priorities (to accept other variations such as `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `L`, `M`, `H`).

</div>

Format: `todo edit INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [date/DATE] [pr/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the todo at the specified [`INDEX`](#).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Parameters given will overwrite the existing values completely.
  * For example, giving 1 or more tag(s) in the edit command will replace all existing tags with the ones given in the edit command.
  * `Coming soon in v1.5`, you can use `tag add` and `tag remove` to modify tags in a todo instead of only using `todo edit`.

Examples:
*  `todo edit 1 d/Read notes for ST2334` Edits the description of the 1st todo to be `Read notes for ST2334`.
*  `todo edit 1 pr/medium t/ST2334` Edits the priority of the 2nd contact to be `medium` and changes its tags to just `ST2334`.
